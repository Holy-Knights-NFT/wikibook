# What are Armor?

## Armor will have the same 5 elements as the character.

The Knight character uses the armor intended for the Knight character.

The Paladin character uses the armor intended for the Paladin character.

The Assassin character uses the armor intended for the Assassin character.

The Witch character uses the armor intended for the Witch character.

The Wizard character uses the armor intended for the Wizard character.

Example: The player cannot use the armor of the Knight character that is used by the Paladin character. Because that armor is not compatible with the Knight character.

Armor helps protect the character in battle by increasing HP and reducing the damage of attacks with elemental resistance.
