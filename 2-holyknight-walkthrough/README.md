![](../assets/overview.png)

## 1. Knight (Characters)

Players need to own at least one character to be able to start playing the game.

There are 5 types of characters: Knight, Paladin, Assassin, Witch and Wizard.

### A. Character Elements

Each character type will come with 1 element: Knight <-> Earth, Paladin <-> Water, Assassin <-> Fire, Witch <-> Air, Wizard <-> Spirit.

Character elements are used to determine advantage calculations and multipliers in combat.

To change your character's elemental, visit the blacksmith at the King's Landing of the HolyKnight Medieverse.

### B. Character Hitpoint

A character's HP is an indicator that represents the character's presence in battle. When this stat down to zero, the character is removed from the battle. The side that gets rid of all the characters in the battle formation will be forfeited.

### C. Character Hierarchy

Characters can be upgraded in 7 tiers as follows:

Private -> Sergeant -> Lieutenant -> Captain -> Major -> Colonel -> General

To upgrade your character's hierarchy, visit the blacksmith at the King's Landing of the HolyKnight Medieverse.

## 2. Weapons

Each weapon will have its own set of character elements, and the character with that element will be required to utilize a weapon with that element.

The weapon will have the same 5 elements as the character.

Character and weapon upgraded system are very similar.

## 3. Armor

Armor is also classified into 5 types to suit each type of character. Armor helps protect the character in battle by increasing HP and reducing the damage of attacks with elemental resistance.

## 4. Shield

Shields have the same 5 elements as armor. Shields help strengthen defense and increase the ability to dodge attacks from the opponent. Shields increase the character's defense.

Legendary Shield is a special shield used to protect the character in battle by significantly increasing the combat power of the entire character. This is a guarantee of the player's victory in all PvE battles. Of course, the price of this Legendary Shield is very expensive and the quantity is limited.

## 5. Blacksmith

Blacksmiths have 3 features: Upgrade, Reforge, Engrave

### A. Upgrade

Character upgrade: Character upgrade to higher hierarchy.

Weapon upgrade: Weapon upgrades make the weapon more powerful when attacking monsters.

Upgrade armor-shield: Armor or shield upgrades to increase defense or dodge from the opponent.

### B. Reforge

Forge a new equipment: Players get trinkets from boss hunting, combine five trinkets into a new equipment.

Increase equipment stats: Players upgrade equipment stats by inserting trinket into current equipment.

### C. Engrave

Engrave the item name according to the player.

## 6. Land

LAND is a limited resource in the game, only 10,000 lots. In which: 4 lots for the King, 60 lots for Barons, 336 lots for Knights, the remaining 9600 lots for Peasants.

Each character owns only one plot of land, which is determined through the classification of the banking system.

### C. Land valuation and sale:
