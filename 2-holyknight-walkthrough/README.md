## Knight (Characters)

Characters are one of the main NFTs the player can possess in HolyKnight.

Each account can hold a maximum of five characters at any given time.

The price to mint characters is displayed on the button in the Plaza tab.

Each character starts at level one, and comes with a chosen element upon minting.

Players may purchase element change potions from the Marketplace to change the elements of their characters.

### Character Elements

Each character comes as one of five different elements \(Spirit, Fire, Earth, Air, Water\).

Character elements are used to determine advantage calculations and multipliers in combat.

### Character Mana

Each character has their own individual mana pool, with a maximum count of 2400.
