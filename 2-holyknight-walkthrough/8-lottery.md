# Holy Knight Lottery

Games. Prizes. Fast. Fun.

## How To Play HolyJackpot:

Simply select six main numbers from 25 to 69 as the Holy numbers are drawn from a different set of balls to the main numbers. You can select your own numbers or use the ‘Quick Pick’ option when buying tickets to randomly generate a set of numbers. Alternatively, you can use the Random Number Generator before you purchase your ticket to find a set of numbers you like.

There are 4 prize tiers on offer in Holyjackpot, and anyone who matches all six main numbers in the draw will win a share of the jackpot, which starts at 10 million $HOLY. If nobody matches all of the numbers in a draw, the jackpot will roll over into the next draw, until it reaches its cap of 90 million $HOLY.
