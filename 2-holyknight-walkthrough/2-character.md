The character is one of the main NFTs that players can own in HolyKnight. To start the game, the player needs to have at least 1 character. Avatar is a special type of character that represents the player himself in the game HolyKnight.

There are a total of 12 battle formations in the game. Each formation allows players to set from 1 to 5 characters. Only by changing the formation, the player can change the battle tactics in the game to win each match.

At the moment, each account can contain up to five characters at any given time. However, this limit can be changed using Avatar's unlock feature.
