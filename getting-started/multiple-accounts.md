# Multiple Accounts

Each wallet address is treated as an account in HolyKnight, and each account can have up to five Knights. To avoid spam, each Knight is limited to 24 strikes each day, and each turn consumes resources and reduces equipment durability. As a result, the player must repair their item in order to use it again.

To create a new account, simply click on the circle icon on the upper right side of your screen and select "Create Account".

Sometimes, HolyKnight may not recognize a second account on the same MetaMask. To resolve this, click on the MetaMask icon in your browser's extensions tab and click on the "Not connected" text.

Click on the "Connect" button when prompted.

Once you are finished, HolyKnight should now detect your new account. If your new account is not yet reflected on the website, simply refresh HolyKnight.
