# Gas Fees

HolyKnight is a totally on-chain platform, which necessitates that players utilizing MATIC pay gas fees on a regular basis.

Gas fees are required to operate on the Polygon Network, and using [Chainlink's VRF](https://docs.chain.link/docs/chainlink-vrf/) technology on-chain assures that all entropy-based gameplay scenarios like minting NFTs or battle are always provably fair.

To secure the capacity to make transactions and engage with the HolyKnight smart contracts, players must always have some quantity of MATIC in their MetaMask wallet.

Gas fees are between 0.0007 to 0.0010 MATIC, depending on the transaction; however, some operations, such as claiming experience, can be more expensive depending on the numerical data involved.

The combat gas charge is set at 0.0025, although this is only the maximum amount the player can pay. Fights have genuine gas costs of roughly 0.0007 MATIC, as shown in your MetaMask transactions.

Gas costs for transactions are subject to volatility depending on network traffic on the Polygon Network.

## Recommended MATIC

Due to the advent of the Early Withdraw Tax, new players are advised to keep a sufficient amount of MATIC to cover gas fees.

The current recommended MATIC quantity is 0.16, give or take a few skill points based on the player's needs.

This quantity will last a player for a week's worth of fights, and it presently costs roughly 0.142 MATIC, plus or minus a few MATIC for network traffic.

The leftover MATIC will be utilized for a variety of operations, including claiming/staking HOLY, claiming experience, forging, and so on.
