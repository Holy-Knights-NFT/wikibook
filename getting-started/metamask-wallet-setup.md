# Getting Started with Blockchain Games

In order to store tokens, users must download a digital wallet to play the game. We recommend using MetaMask. Metamask can be used on both desktop and mobile. For mobile users, Trust Wallet can also be used on Android but it does not have a browser on iOS.

Hereâ€™s a quick video tutorial!

## Download and Install MetaMask

[MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) can be downloaded as a browser extension on any compatible browser.

The links to download MetaMask can be found here for [**Chrome Web Store**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn), [**Firefox Add-ons**](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ether-metamask/), and [**Edge Add-ons**](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/metamask/ejbalbakoplchlghecdalmeeeajnimhm).

MetaMask is also compatible with Brave browser.

MetaMask can also be installed on [**Android**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.metamask&hl=en_US&ref=producthunt&_branch_match_id=739701339152755845), and [**iOS**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/metamask/id1438144202?_branch_match_id=739701339152755845).

## Creating an Account

Once MetaMask has been downloaded and installed, you may proceed to create an account.

The steps to create an account are outlined below:

1. Click on the "Create a Wallet" button.
2. Create a password. This will be used when logging in to MetaMask in the same browser.
3. View your secret seed phrase and write it down on a secure location.
4. Select each phrase in order and click "Confirm".

Your seed phrase will be used if you want to import your wallet to a fresh MetaMask install on a different browser and/or device.

Never give your seed phrase out to anyone. This can be used similar to your password to access your account.

HolyKnight developers and moderators will never ask for your seed phrase and password.
{% endhint %}

## Connecting to the Polygon Network

After you create an account on MetaMask, it will default to the Ethereum Mainnet.

HolyKnight and HOLY Tokens (ERC20 & ERC721) requires your wallet to be set to the Polygon Mainnet (formerly Matic Network).

The steps to add the Polygon network are outlined below:

1. Go to the Settings menu by clicking on the circle in the upper right hand side of the screen.

- Chain ID: 137
- Currency Symbol: MATIC
- Block Explorer URL: https://polygonscan.com/
